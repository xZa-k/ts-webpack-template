# ts-webpack-template

### A webpack template that includes a server and client.

- Hosted on port 8080
- By default proxies /api to localhost:3000
- Plain typescript, no frameworks included
- Kind of scuffed, but works for me 


## How to run
Simply use the command `npm i` in the root directory, it will run a script to install all dependencies in the `server` and `client` folders.

Afterwards, run `npm start` this should run the webpack server for the client and the node server.


## Prerequisites
- npm
